## Developer guidelines 
We ask from our developers that they follow these guidelines in order to create a clear overview for our leads. Communication is very
important when you work on larger projects with multiple developers. Because of our guidelines we are able to maintain a clear overview
for each project we work on.

### Committing
Every commit made by a developer should be small with a compact explanation. The new feature must be tested and properly function
before you are allowed to commit it. This commit should contain at least one of the words defined below.
- [Added]
- [Fixed]
- [Removed]
- [Changed]

### Merging
We expect developers to work on different branches. Each branch will contain its own feature. An example could be a website where one
branch is a login system and another is for responsive design. Once these features are completely finsihed an thoroughly tested, they
can be merged with master.
Merging has shown to be difficult in the past so make sure that you don't cause conflicts with the master branch and try to be carefull
when you merge.
